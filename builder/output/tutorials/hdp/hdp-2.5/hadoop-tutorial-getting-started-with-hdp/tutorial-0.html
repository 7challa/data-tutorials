<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello World is often used by developers to familiarize themselves with new concepts by building a simple program. This tutorial aims to achieve a similar purpose by getting practitioners started with Hadoop and HDP. We will use an Internet of Things (IoT) use case to build your first HDP application.</p>

<p>This tutorial describes how to refine data for a Trucking IoT  <a href="https://hortonworks.com/solutions/advanced-analytic-apps/#data-discovery">Data Discovery</a> (aka IoT Discovery) use case using the Hortonworks Data Platform. The IoT Discovery use cases involves vehicles, devices and people moving across a map or similar surface. Your analysis is targeted to linking location information with your analytic data.</p>

<p>For our tutorial we are looking at a use case where we have a truck fleet. Each truck has been equipped to log location and event data. These events are streamed back to a datacenter where we will be processing the data.  The company wants to use this data to better understand risk.</p>

<p>Here is the video of <a href="http://youtu.be/n8fdYHoEEAM">Analyzing Geolocation Data</a> to show you what you’ll be doing in this tutorial.</p>
