## Known Issues

- Docker version of Sandbox for Windows is not compatible with Docker version 18.06.1-ce. Users deploying the Sandbox using Docker on Windows must use Docker [version: 18.03.0-ce](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/#docker-community-edition-18030-ce-win59-2018-03-26).

## Limitations

This is a list of common limitations along with their workarounds.

- Pig Views is no longer a part of HDP, Pig scripts are interpreted using Grub. Additionally, a [Zeppelin Pig interpreter](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0/interpreter/pig.html) can be used
- LLAP not enabled by default, Hive is used without LLAP

## HDP Services Not Started Automatically on Startup

Because of the limited resources available in the sandbox virtual machine environment, the following services are in maintenance mode and will not automatically start. To fully use these services, you must allocate more memory to the sandbox virtual machine. If you want these services to automatically start, turn off maintenance mode. The processes are listed with their main class.

- Ambari Metrics
- Atlas
  - Main - org.apache.atlas.Main
- HDFS
  - SecondaryNameNode - org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.SecondaryNameNode
  - Since on a single node, secondary namenode is not needed, it is not started.
- HBase
  - HRegionServer - org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer
  - HMaster - org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.HMaster
- Kafka
  - Kafka – kafka.Kafka
- Knox
  - gateway.jar - /usr/hdp/current/knox-server/bin/gateway.jar
  - ldap.jar - /usr/hdp/current/knox-server/bin/ldap.jar This process is a mini ldap server
- Druid
  - org.sparklinedata.druid
- Superset
- Storm
  - supervisor - backtype.storm.daemon.supervisor
  - nimbus - backtype.storm.daemon.nimbus
  - logviewer - backtype.storm.daemon.logviewer
  - core - backtype.storm.ui.core
