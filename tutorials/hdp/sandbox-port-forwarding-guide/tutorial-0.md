# Sandbox Port Forwarding Guide

# Current Sandbox Architecture

## Introduction

This informational tutorial will explain the current Hortonworks Sandbox architecture, starting in HDP 2.6.5 a new Sandbox structure is introduced making it possible to instantiate two single node clusters (i.e. HDP and HDF) within a single Sandbox with the purpose of combining the best features of the Data-At-Rest and Data-In-Motion methodologies in a single environment. Have a look at the graphical representation of the Sandbox below, it shows where the Sandbox exists in relation to the outside world, the specific instance depicted is the Connected Data Architecure (CDA) if you are not yet familiarized with the concept of CDA do not worry, we'll review this in a later section.

At a high level the Sandbox is a Linux (CentOS) Virtual Machine leveraging docker to host different Sandbox distributions, namely [HDP](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-platforms/hdp/) or [HDF](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-platforms/hdf/). In order to orchestrate communication between the outside world and the Sandbox a reverse proxy server NGINX is containerized and configured to only open the ports needed to the outside world enabling us to granularly interact with containers; moreover, the inter-container communication is delegated to Docker's internal network.

## Docker Architecture

[![cda-architecture](assets/docker-architecture.jpg)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/)

In the Docker architecture above, Docker registry are services used for storing Docker images, such as Docker Hub. Docker Host is the computer Docker runs on. Diving deeper into the host, you can see the Docker Daemon, which is used to create and manage Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks and volumes. The user or client is able to interact with Docker daemon via Client Docker CLI. The Docker daemon is a long-running program also known as a server. The CLI utilizes Dockerâ€™s REST API to interact with the Docker daemon. As you can observe, the Docker Engine is a client-server application comprised of Client Docker CLI, REST API and Docker daemon.

### View Running Containers

If you would like to visualize the running Sandbox container and proxy you you must log on to the host, you may chose to follow along; however, it is not necessary. If you use the standard sandbox `ssh -p 2222 root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com`, you will actually log into the sandbox container, not the containing VM where Docker changes are made. You want to log into the VM running Docker with the following command:

If you are running a VirtualBox Sandbox:

~~~bash
# SSH on to the sandbox using Virtual Box
ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 2202
~~~

Or if you are using VMWare:

~~~bash
# SSH on to the sandbox using VMWare
ssh root@sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com -p 22
~~~

> Note: The default password is **hadoop**.

Now that you are in the Virtual Machine hosting the containers view the running containers within docker:

~~~bash
docker ps
~~~

If you started out with HDP you will see two containers running, the first is the NGINX proxy container followed by a list of open ports and where they are being forwarded. Because, in this case, HDP was used as a base we can see that it is also listed as a running container.

 here is some context on the information displayed:

|                      CONTAINER ID                      |                                   IMAGE                                  |                                          COMMAND                                          |                 CREATED                 |                              STATUS                             |                                            PORTS                                            |                              NAMES                              |
|:------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Container ID given to an instantiated image by docker. | The executable package from which your container has been instantiated.  | Command used to instantiate your container, typically this is the path of an initialization script. | How long ago the container was created. | A container may be: </br>UP</br> UP-PAUSED </br>RESTARTING </br>DEAD </br>CREATED </br>EXITED | Open ports. Note that the proxy container also tells us where ports are being forwarded to. | This is the container name e.g. "sandbox-hdp" & "sandbox-proxy" |

When CDA has been deployed both HDP and HDF are displayed as running containers:

The script in the VM that creates configures the proxy server is located at:

~~~bash
/sandbox/proxy/generate-proxy-deploy-script.sh
~~~

## What is CDA?

Hortonworks Connected Data Architecture (CDA) is composed of both Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF) and Hortonworks DataPlatform (HDP) sandboxes and allows you to play with both data-in-motion and data-at-rest frameworks simultaneously.

![hortonworks-connected-data-platforms](assets/HDF_secure_data_collection.png)

As data is coming in from the edge, it is collected, curated and analyzed in real-time, on premise or in the cloud using the HDF framework. You can also convert the your Data-In-Motion into Data-At-Rest with the HDP framework. HDP allows you to store, manage and perform further analytics. In order for HDF to send data into HDP, both sandboxes need to be set up to communicate with each other.

CDA takes advantage of the sandboxes properties of being Docker containers by taking the HDF Docker container as the base sandbox inside a virtual machine.
 A bridge was created between these two sandboxes through Docker Engine. One of the many advantages of being a container inside Docker Engine is that containers can communicate directly with each other through a Docker network named bridge.

## Summary

You've successfully modified the sandbox container's startup script and VirtualBox settings in order to add in new port forwards.  The forwarded ports allow you to access processes running on the sandbox from your host system (i.e. your computer and browser).
