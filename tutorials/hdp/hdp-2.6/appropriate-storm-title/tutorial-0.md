# Some Storm Trucking Title

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the core concepts of Storm and the role it plays in an environment where real-time, low-latency and distributed data processing is important.

We will build a Storm topology from the ground up and demonstrate a full data pipeline, from Internet of Things (IoT) data ingestion from the edge, to data processing with Storm, to persisting this data and viewing it in a visualization web application.
