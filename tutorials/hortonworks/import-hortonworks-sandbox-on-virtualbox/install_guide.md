# Hortonworks Sandbox with VirtualBox

## Overview

The Hortonworks Sandbox is delivered as a virtual appliance.  The virtual appliance (indicated by an .ovf or .ova extension in the filename) runs in the context of a virtual machine (VM), a piece of software that appears to be an application to the underlying (host) operating system (OS), but that looks like a bare machine, including CPU, storage, network adapters, and so forth, to the operating system and applications that run on it.

To use the Hortonworks Sandbox, one of the supported virtual machine applications needs to installed on your host machine:

·      VirtualBox
·      VMware Fusion
·      Hyper-V
