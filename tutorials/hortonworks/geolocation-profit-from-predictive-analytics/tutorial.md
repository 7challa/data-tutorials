Where is everyone? Geolocation data is plentiful, and thatâ€™s part of the challenge. The costs to store and process voluminous amounts of data often outweigh the benefits. Hadoop helps reduce data storage costs while providing value driven intelligence from asset tracking to predicting behavior to enable optimization.

See how a trucking company can analyze geolocation data to reduce fuel costs and improve driver safety.

### This demo showed how to:

*   Stream geolocation data into [HDFS](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hdfs) with [Flume](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/flume)
*   Import structured data into HDFS with [Sqoop](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/)
*   Use [HCatalog](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hcatalog) to build a relational view of the data
*   Use [Hive](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hive) and [Pig](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/pig) scripts to refine the data
*   Import the data into Microsoft Excel with the [ODBC connector](http://hortonworks.com//hdp/add_ons)
*   Visualize data with Powerview
