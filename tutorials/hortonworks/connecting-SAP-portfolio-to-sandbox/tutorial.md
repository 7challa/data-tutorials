### **SAP HANA  and the Hortonworks Data Platform**

You can connect SAP HANA to your Hortonworks Data Platform cluster. It’s not a Sandbox tutorial, but rather a cloud demo. Here are the [instructions](http://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Demo-Tutorial-Leveraging_SAP_HANA__HDP_Jan_2014.pdf).

### **Creating a BusinessObjects Universe on HDP and the Sandbox 2.0**

Hive was designed to be the data warehouse on Hadoop. As such it is a versatile and convenient way to get immediate value out of your Hadoop data with your existing SAP BusinessObjects BI4 platform and all BI clients that consume Universes (SAP Lumira included). Once a Universe is created on Hive and published to the platform, users can consume it as any other Universe from any other data source.

This tutorial provides instructions on creating a Universe on either the Hortonworks Data Platform or the Hortonworks Sandbox.
