## Tutorial for Sandbox 2.0 version

### Introduction to Hunk Architecture

Hunk is a high performance, scalable software server written in Java, C/C++ and Python. Hunk works with machine data generated by any application, server or device. The Splunk Developer API is accessible via REST or the command line.

After downloading, installing and starting Hunk, you’ll find two Hunk Server processes running on your host: splunkd and splunkweb.

*   **splunkd** is a distributed C/C++ server that accesses, processes and creates a virtual index from machine data and handles search requests. splunkd supports a command line interface for searching and viewing results.

*   **splunkweb** is a Python-based application server providing the Splunk Web user interface. It allows you to search and navigate machine data accessible by Hunk and to manage your Hunk deployment using your browser.
