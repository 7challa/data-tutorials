MicroStrategy uses Apache Hive (via ODBC connection) as the defacto standard for SQL access in Hadoop.

Establishing a connection from MicroStrategy to Hadoop and the Hortonworks Sandbox is fairly straight forward. While the MicroStrategy Analytics Platform provides a comprehensive set of analytics and business intelligence capabilities, the Analytics Desktop is one component of the platform that gives business users an easy and convenient option to get started with MicroStrategy.

The process described here is for MicroStrategy Analytics Desktop installed on Windows, but the approach is similar when using the MicroStrategy Analytics Platform with Hortonworks on non-Windows platforms (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX).

### Before you get started:


1.  Download the [Hortonworks Sandbox 2.0.](http://hortonworks.com/sandbox)
2.  Download the 100% Free [MicroStrategy Analytics Desktop product](http://www.microstrategy.com/free/desktop)
