# NiFi in Trucking IoT

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the core concepts of Apache NiFi and the role it plays in an environment in which Flow Management, Ease of Use, Security, Extensible Architecture and Flexible Scaling Model are important.

We will create a NiFi DataFlow for transferring data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the edge to our stream application.

## Prerequisites

- Downloaded and deployed the [Cloudera DataFlow (CDF)](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox/hdf.html?utm_source=mktg-tutorial) Sandbox

## Outline

- [NiFi in Trucking IoT Use Case](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/nifi-in-trucking-iot/section/1/) - Discuss a real-world use and understand the role NiFi plays within it
- [Run NiFi in the Demo](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/nifi-in-trucking-iot/section/2/)- Walk through the DataFlow Management portion of the demo and gain an understanding of it in the data pipeline
- [Creating a NiFi DataFlow](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/nifi-in-trucking-iot/section/3/) - Dive into NiFi internals and build a dataflow from scratch
