**Introduction**

Tableau is one of the world’s fastest-growing business intelligence companies, Tableau helps anyone quickly analyze, visualize and share information. More than 10,000 organizations get rapid results with Tableau in the office and on-the-go. And tens of thousands of people use Tableau Public to share data in their blogs and websites. As with most BI tools Tableau can use Apache Hive (via ODBC connection) as the defacto standard for SQL access in Hadoop. Establishing a connection from Tableau to Hadoop and the Hortonworks Sandbox is fairly straightforward and we will describe the process in the tutorial.
