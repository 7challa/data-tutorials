<h2 id="what-is-pig-a-idwhat-is-piga">What is Pig? <a id="what-is-pig"></a></h2>

<p>Pig is a high level scripting language that is used with Apache Hadoop. Pig excels at describing data analysis problems as data flows. Pig is complete in that you can do all the required data manipulations in Apache Hadoop with Pig. In addition through the User Defined Functions(UDF) facility in Pig you can have Pig invoke code in many languages like JRuby, Jython and Java. Conversely you can execute Pig scripts in other languages. The result is that you can use Pig as a component to build larger and more complex applications that tackle real business problems.</p>

<p>A good example of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig application</code> is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ETL transaction model</code> that describes how a process will extract data from a source, transform it according to a rule set and then load it into a datastore. Pig can ingest data from files, streams or other sources using the User Defined Functions(UDF). Once it has the data it can perform select, iteration, and other transforms over the data. Again the UDF feature allows passing the data to more complex algorithms for the transform. Finally Pig can store the results into the Hadoop Data File System.</p>

<p>Pig scripts are translated into a series of <code class="highlighter-rouge">MapReduce jobs</code> that are run on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Apache  Hadoop cluster</code>. As part of the translation the Pig interpreter does perform optimizations to speed execution on Apache Hadoop. We are going to write a Pig script that will do our data analysis task.</p>

<h2 id="our-data-processing-task-a-idour-data-processing-taska">Our Data Processing Task <a id="our-data-processing-task"></a></h2>

<p>We are going to read in a baseball statistics file. We are going to compute the highest runs by a player for each year. This file has all the statistics from 1871â€“2011 and it contains over 90,000 rows. Once we have the highest runs we will extend the script to translate a player id field into the first and last names of the players.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-download-the-data-a-iddownloading-the-dataa">Step 1: Download The Data <a id="downloading-the-data"></a></h3>

<p>The data file we are using comes from the site <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com">www.seanlahman.com</a>. You can download the data file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">csv zip</code>:</p>

<p><a href="http://hortonassets.s3.amazonaws.com/pig/lahman591-csv.zip">lahman591-csv.zip</a></p>

<p>Once you have the file you will need to <code class="highlighter-rouge">unzip</code> the file into a directory. We will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">uploading</code> just the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master.csv</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">batting.csv</code> files.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-upload-the-data-files-a-iduploading-data-filesa">Step 2: Upload the data files <a id="uploading-data-files"></a></h3>

<p>We start by selecting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HDFS Files view</code> from the Off-canvas menu at the top. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">HDFS Files view</code> allows us to view the Hortonworks Data Platform(HDP) file store. This is separate from the local file system. For the Hortonworks Sandbox, it will be part of the file system in the Hortonworks Sandbox VM.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/hello-hdp/hdfs_files_view_hello_hdp_lab1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigate to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/maria_dev</code> and click on the Upload button to select the files we want to upload into the Hortonworks Sandbox environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/user_mariadev_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click on the browse button to open a dialog box. Navigate to where you stored the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Batting.csv</code> file on your local disk and select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Batting.csv</code> and click again upload. Do the same thing for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Master.csv</code>. When you are done you will see there are two files in your directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/upload_baseball_stat_files_process_data_hive.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-create-pig-script-a-idcreate-pig-scripta">Step 3: Create Pig Script <a id="create-pig-script"></a></h3>

<p>Now that we have our data files, we can start writing our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig script</code>. Click on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig button</code> from the Off-canvas menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/pig_view_icon_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="explore-the-pig-user-interface">3.1 Explore the Pig User Interface</h4>

<p>We see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig user interface</code> in our browser window. On the left we can choose between our <code class="highlighter-rouge">saved Pig  Scripts</code>,  <code class="highlighter-rouge">UDFs</code>  and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig  Jobs</code> executed in the past. To the right of this menu bar we see our <code class="highlighter-rouge">saved Pig  Scripts</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-use-basic-pig-commands/pig_dashboard_use_basic_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="create-a-new-script">3.2 Create a New Script</h4>

<p>To get started push the button <code class="highlighter-rouge">"New Script"</code> at the top right and fill in a name for your script. If you leave the gap "Script HDFS Location" empty, it will be filled automatically.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/t2_new_script_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After clicking on "create", a new page opens.<br />
At the center is the composition area where we will be writing our script. At top right of the composition area are buttons to Execute, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Explain  and perform a Syntax check</code> of the current script.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/pig_user_interface_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the left are buttons to save, copy or delete the script and at the very bottom we can add a argument.</p>

<h4 id="create-a-script-to-load-battingcsv-data">3.3 Create a Script to Load Batting.csv Data</h4>

<p>The first thing we need to do is load the data. We use the load statement for this. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">PigStorage</code> function is what does the loading and we pass it a <code class="highlighter-rouge">comma</code> as the data <code class="highlighter-rouge">delimiter</code>. Our code is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>batting = load 'Batting.csv' using PigStorage(',');
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/load_batting_data_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="create-a-script-to-filter-out-data">3.4 Create a Script to Filter Out Data</h4>

<p>To filter out the first row of the data we have to add this line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>raw_runs = FILTER batting BY $1&gt;0;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/filter_out_data_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="implement-a-script-to-name-the-fields">3.5 Implement a Script to Name the Fields</h4>

<p>The next thing we want to do is name the fields. We will use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOREACH</code> statement to iterate through the batting data object. We can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig  Helper</code> that is at the bottom of the composition area to provide us with a template. We will click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig  Helper</code>, select Data processing functions and then click on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOREACH template</code>. We can then replace each element by hitting the tab key.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/foreach_name_fields_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOREACH</code> statement will iterate through the batting data object and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENERATE</code> pulls out selected fields and assigns them names. The new data object we are creating is then named runs. Our code will now be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>runs = FOREACH raw_runs GENERATE $0 as playerID, $1 as year, $8 as runs;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/iterate_pullfields_assign_names_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="use-script-to-filter-the-data-allruns-for-each-year">3.6 Use Script to Filter The Data (all_runs for each year)</h4>

<p>The next line of code is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GROUP</code> statement that groups the elements in runs by the year field. So the grp_data object will then be indexed by year. In the next statement as we iterate through grp_data we will go through year by year. Type in the code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>grp_data = GROUP runs by (year);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/group_runs_year_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="compose-a-script-to-search-for-max-runs-per-year">3.7 Compose a Script to Search for Max Runs Per Year</h4>

<p>In the next <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOREACH</code> statement, we are going to find the maximum runs for each year. The code for this is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>max_runs = FOREACH grp_data GENERATE group as grp,MAX(runs.runs) as max_runs;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/search_max_runs_peryear_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="build-a-script-to-join-year-playerid-and-max-run">3.8 Build a Script to join Year, PlayerID and Max Run</h4>

<p>Now that we have the maximum runs we need to join this with the runs data object so we can pick up the player id. The result will be a dataset with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Year,  PlayerID  and  Max  Run</code>. At the end we <code class="highlighter-rouge">DUMP</code> the data to the output.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>join_max_run = JOIN max_runs by ($0, max_runs), runs by (year,runs);  
join_data = FOREACH join_max_run GENERATE $0 as year, $2 as playerID, $1 as runs;  
DUMP join_data;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/join_yer_playerid_maxrun_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let's take a look at our script. The first thing to notice is we never really address single rows of data to the left of the equals sign and on the right we just describe what we want to do for each row. We just assume things are applied to all the rows. We also have powerful operators like <code class="highlighter-rouge">GROUP</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> to sort rows by a key and to build new data objects.</p>

<h4 id="save-and-execute-the-script">3.9 Save and Execute The Script</h4>

<p>At this point we can save our script. Let's execute our code by clicking on the execute button at the top right of the composition area, which opens a new page.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/save_execute_script_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the jobs are run we will get status boxes where we will see logs, error message, the output of our script and our code at the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/results_script_process_data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you scroll down to the "Logsâ€¦" and click on the link you can see the log file of your jobs. We should always check the Logs to check if your script was executed correctly.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hortonworks/tutorials/hdp/assets/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig/results_logs_process_Data_pig.png" alt="" /></p>

<h5 id="code-recap">Code Recap</h5>

<p>So we have created a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig script</code> that <strong>reads in some comma separated data.</strong><br />
Once we have that set of records in Pig we <strong>pull out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">playerID, year and runs fields</code> from each row.</strong><br />
We then <strong>sort them by <code class="highlighter-rouge">year</code></strong> with one statement, <code class="highlighter-rouge">GROUP</code>.<br />
Then we <strong>find the maximum runs for each year.</strong><br />
This is finally <strong>mapped to the playerID</strong> and we produce our final dataset.</p>

<p>As mentioned before <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig</code> operates on data flows. We consider each group of rows together and we specify how we operate on them as a group. As the datasets get larger and/or add fields our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pig script</code> will remain pretty much the same because it is concentrating on how we want to manipulate the data.</p>
