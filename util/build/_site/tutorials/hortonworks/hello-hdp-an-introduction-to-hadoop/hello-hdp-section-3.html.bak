<h2 id="loading-sensor-data-into-hdfs">Loading Sensor Data into HDFS</h2>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this section, you will download the sensor data and load that into HDFS using Ambari User Views. You will get introduced to the Ambari Files User View to manage files. You can perform tasks like create directories, navigate file systems and upload files to HDFS.  In addition, you’ll perform a few other file-related tasks as well.  Once you get the basics, you will create two directories and then load two files into HDFS using the Ambari Files User View.</p>

<p>A single physical machine gets saturated with its storage capacity as the data grows. This growth drives the need to partition your data across separate machines. This type of File system that manages storage of data across a network of machines is called Distributed File Systems. <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/thinking-about-the-hdfs-vs-other-storage-technologies/">HDFS</a> is a core component of Apache Hadoop and is designed to store large files with streaming data access patterns, running on clusters of commodity hardware. With Hortonworks Data Platform HDP 2.2, HDFS is now expanded to support <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/heterogeneous-storage-policies-hdp-2-2/">heterogeneous storage</a>  media within the HDFS cluster.</p>

<h2 id="step-11-download-and-extract-the-sensor-data-files-a-idstep11a">Step 1.1: Download and Extract the Sensor Data Files <a id="step1.1"></a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can download the sample sensor data contained in a compressed (.zip) folder here:  <a href="https://app.box.com/HadoopCrashCourseData"><strong>Geolocation.zip</strong></a></li>
  <li>Save the Geolocation.zip file to your computer, then extract the files. You should see a Geolocation folder that contains the following files:
    <ul>
      <li>geolocation.csv – This is the collected geolocation data from the trucks. It contains <strong>records</strong> showing <em>truck location, date, time, type of event, speed, etc</em>.</li>
      <li>trucks.csv – This is data was exported from a relational database and it shows <strong>info</strong> on <em>truck models, driverid, truckid, and aggregated mileage info</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-12-load-the-sensor-data-into-hdfs-a-idstep12a">Step 1.2: Load the Sensor Data into HDFS <a id="step1.2"></a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Go to the Ambari Dashboard and open the <strong>HDFS Files</strong> view. Click on the 9 square Ambari User Views icon next to the username button and select the <strong>HDFS Files</strong> menu item.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Start from the top root of the HDFS file system, you will see all the files the logged in user (<em>maria_dev</em> in this case) has access to see:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/hdfs_files_user_view_maria_dev_hello_hdp.png" alt="Lab2_2" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>tmp</strong> folder. Then click  ![Lab2<em>3](/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_3.png) button to create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">maria_dev</code> directory inside the _tmp</em> folder. Then create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory inside <em>maria_dev</em> folder. Now navigate into the <strong>data</strong> folder.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If your not already in your newly created directory path <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/maria_dev/data</code>, go to the <strong>data</strong> folder. Then upload the corresponding <strong>geolocation.csv</strong> and <strong>trucks.csv</strong> files into it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also perform the following operations on a file by right clicking on the file: <strong>Download</strong>, <strong>Move</strong>, <strong>Permissions</strong>, <strong>Rename</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Right click on the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> which is contained within the directory path <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/maria_dev</code>. Click <strong>Permissions</strong>. Make sure that the background of all the <strong>write</strong> boxes are checked (<strong>blue</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! Let’s summarize the skills and knowledge we acquired from this tutorial. We learned <strong>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</strong> was built to manage storing data across multiple machines. Now we can upload data into the HDFS using Ambari’s HDFS <strong>Files view</strong>.</p>
