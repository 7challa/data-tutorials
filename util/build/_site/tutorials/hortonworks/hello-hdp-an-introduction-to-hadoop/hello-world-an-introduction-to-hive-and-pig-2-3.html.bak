  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This tutorial describes how to refine data for a Trucking IoT  <a href="http://hortonworks.com/solutions/advanced-analytic-apps/#data-discovery">Data Discovery</a> (aka IoT Discovery) use case using the Hortonworks Data Platform. The IoT Discovery use cases involves vehicles, devices and people moving across a map or similar surface. Your analysis is interested in tying together location information with your analytic data.</p>

<p>Hello World is often used by developers to familiarize themselves with new concepts by building a simple program. This tutorial aims to achieve a similar purpose by getting practitioners started with Hadoop and HDP. We will use an Internet of Things (IoT) use case to build your first HDP application.</p>

<p>For our tutorial we are looking at a use case where we have a truck fleet. Each truck has been equipped to log location and event data. These events are streamed back to a datacenter where we will be processing the data.  The company wants to use this data to better understand risk.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-1"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>In this module you will learn about Apache Hadoop and what makes it scale to large data sets. We will also talk about various components of Hadoop ecosystem that make Apache Hadoop enterprise ready in form of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) distribution. The module discusses Apache Hadoop, its capabilities as a data platform and how the core of Hadoop and its surrounding ecosystem solution vendors provides the enterprise requirements to integrate alongside the Data Warehouse and other enterprise data systems as part of a modern data architecture, and as a step on the journey toward delivering an enterprise ‘Data Lake’</p>

<h4 id="goals-of-this-module"><strong>Goals of this module</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding Hadoop.</li>
  <li>Understanding five pillars of HDP</li>
  <li>Understanding HDP components and their purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Apache Hadoop:</strong></p>

<p>Apache Hadoop® is an open source framework for distributed storage and processing of large sets of data on commodity hardware. Hadoop enables businesses to quickly gain insight from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Numerous Apache Software Foundation projects make up the services required by an enterprise to deploy, integrate and work with Hadoop.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hortonworks Blog : <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/understanding-hadoop-2-0/">Understanding Hadoop 2.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hadoop Common</strong> – contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules.</li>
  <li><strong>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</strong> – a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Hadoop YARN</strong> – a resource-management platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them for scheduling of users’ applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong> – a programming model for large scale data processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project has been developed to deliver an explicit function and each has its own community of developers and individual release cycles. There are five pillars to Hadoop that make it enterprise ready:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Management</strong>– Store and process vast quantities of data in a storage layer that scales linearly. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the core technology for the efficient scale out storage layer, and is designed to run across low-cost commodity hardware. Apache Hadoop YARN is the pre-requisite for Enterprise Hadoop as it provides the resource management and pluggable architecture for enabling a wide variety of data access methods to operate on data stored in Hadoop with predictable performance and service levels.

<h2 id="concepts-hdfs">Concepts: HDFS</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-2"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>A single physical machine gets saturated with its storage capacity as the data grows. Thereby comes impending need to partition your data across separate machines. This type of File system that manages storage of data across a network of machines is called Distributed File Systems. <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/thinking-about-the-hdfs-vs-other-storage-technologies/">HDFS</a> is a core component of Apache Hadoop and is designed to store large files with streaming data access patterns, running on clusters of commodity hardware. With Hortonworks Data Platform HDP 2.2, HDFS is now expanded to support <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/heterogeneous-storage-policies-hdp-2-2/">heterogeneous storage</a>  media within the HDFS cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Goals of this module</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding HDFS architecture</li>
  <li>Understanding Hortonworks Sandbox Amabri File User View</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hadoop Distributed File System</strong></p>

<p>HDFS is a distributed file system that is designed for storing large data files. HDFS is a Java-based file system that provides scalable and reliable data storage, and it was designed to span large clusters of commodity servers. HDFS has demonstrated production scalability of up to 200 PB of storage and a single cluster of 4500 servers, supporting close to a billion files and blocks. HDFS is a scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed storage system that works closely with a wide variety of concurrent data access applications, coordinated by YARN. HDFS will “just work” under a variety of physical and systemic circumstances. By distributing storage and computation across many servers, the combined storage resource can grow linearly with demand while remaining economical at every amount of storage.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/HDSF_1.png" alt="HDSF_1" /></p>

<p>An HDFS cluster is comprised of a NameNode, which manages the cluster metadata, and DataNodes that store the data. Files and directories are represented on the NameNode by inodes. Inodes record attributes like permissions, modification and access times, or namespace and disk space quotas.</p>

<p>The file content is split into large blocks (typically 128 megabytes), and each block of the file is independently replicated at multiple DataNodes. The blocks are stored on the local file system on the DataNodes.</p>

<p>The Namenode actively monitors the number of replicas of a block. When a replica of a block is lost due to a DataNode failure or disk failure, the NameNode creates another replica of the block. The NameNode maintains the namespace tree and the mapping of blocks to DataNodes, holding the entire namespace image in RAM.</p>

<p>The NameNode does not directly send requests to DataNodes. It sends instructions to the DataNodes by replying to heartbeats sent by those DataNodes. The instructions include commands to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>replicate blocks to other nodes,</li>
  <li>remove local block replicas,</li>
  <li>re-register and send an immediate block report, or</li>
  <li>shut down the node.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ambari Files User View provides a user friendly interface to upload, store and move data. Underlying all components in Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System(<a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hdfs/">HDFS</a>™).  This is the foundation of the Hadoop cluster. The HDFS file system manages how the datasets are stored in the Hadoop cluster. It is responsible for distributing the data across the datanodes, managing replication for redundancy and administrative tasks like adding, removing and recovery of data nodes.</p>

<h2 id="concepts-mapreduce--yarn">Concepts: MapReduce &amp; YARN</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-3"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>Cluster computing faces several challenges such as how to store data persistently and keep it available if nodes fail or how to deal with node failures during a long running computation. Then there is network bottleneck which delays the time of processing data. MapReduce offers a solution by bring computation close to data thereby minimizing data movement. It is a simple programming model designed for process large volumes of data in parallel by dividing the job into a set of independent tasks.</p>

<p>The biggest limitation with MapReduce programming is that map and reduce jobs are not stateless. This means that Reduce jobs have to wait for map jobs to be completed first. This limits maximum parallelism and therefore <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/philosophy-behind-yarn-resource-management/">YARN</a> was born as a generic resource management and distributed application framework.</p>

<p><strong>Goals of the Module</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding Map and Reduce jobs.</li>
  <li>Understanding YARN</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/mapreduce/"><strong>Apache MapReduce</strong></a></p>

<p>MapReduce is the key algorithm that the Hadoop data processing engine uses to distribute work around a cluster. A MapReduce job splits a large data set into independent chunks and organizes them into key, value pairs for parallel processing. This parallel processing improves the speed and reliability of the cluster, returning solutions more quickly and with greater reliability.</p>

<p>The <strong>Map</strong> function divides the input into ranges by the InputFormat and creates a map task for each range in the input. The JobTracker distributes those tasks to the worker nodes. The output of each map task is partitioned into a group of key-value pairs for each reduce.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">map(key1,value) -&gt; list&lt;key2,value2&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Reduce</strong> function then collects the various results and combines them to answer the larger problem that the master node needs to solve. Each reduce pulls the relevant partition from the machines where the maps executed, then writes its output back into HDFS. Thus, the reduce is able to collect the data from all of the maps for the keys and combine them to solve the problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">reduce(key2, list&lt;value2&gt;) -&gt; list&lt;value3&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The current Apache Hadoop MapReduce System is composed of the JobTracker, which is the master, and the per-node slaves called TaskTrackers. The JobTracker is responsible for <em>resource management</em> (managing the worker nodes i.e. TaskTrackers), <em>tracking resource consumption/availability</em> and also <em>job life-cycle management</em> (scheduling individual tasks of the job, tracking progress, providing fault-tolerance for tasks etc).</p>

<p>The TaskTracker has simple responsibilities – launch/teardown tasks on orders from the JobTracker and provide task-status information to the JobTracker periodically.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/MapR_1.png" alt="MapR_1" /></p>

<p>The Apache Hadoop projects provide a series of tools designed to solve big data problems. The Hadoop cluster implements a parallel computing cluster using inexpensive commodity hardware. The cluster is partitioned across many servers to provide a near linear scalability. The philosophy of the cluster design is to bring the computing to the data. So each datanode will hold part of the overall data and be able to process the data that it holds. The overall framework for the processing software is called MapReduce. Here’s a short video introduction to MapReduce:</p>

<h3 id="apache-yarn-yet-another-resource-negotiator"><a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-hadoop-yarn-background-and-an-overview/">Apache YARN</a> <strong>(Yet Another Resource Negotiator):</strong></h3>

<p>Hadoop HDFS is the data storage layer for Hadoop and MapReduce was the data-processing layer in Hadoop 1x. However, the MapReduce algorithm, by itself, isn’t sufficient for the very wide variety of use-cases we see Hadoop being employed to solve. Hadoop 2.0 presents YARN, as a generic resource-management and distributed application framework, whereby, one can implement multiple data processing applications customized for the task at hand. The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the two major responsibilities of the JobTracker i.e. resource management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate daemons: a global <strong>ResourceManager</strong> and per-application <strong>ApplicationMaster</strong> (AM).</p>

<p>The ResourceManager and per-node slave, the NodeManager (NM), form the new, and generic, <strong>system</strong> for managing applications in a distributed manner.</p>

<p>The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a <em>framework specific</em> entity and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the component tasks.</p>

<p><a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager/">ResourceManager</a> has a pluggable <strong>Scheduler</strong>, which is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications subject to familiar constraints of capacities, queues etc. The Scheduler is a <em>pure scheduler</em> in the sense that it performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application, offering no guarantees on restarting failed tasks either due to application failure or hardware failures. The Scheduler performs its scheduling function based on the <em>resource requirements</em> of the applications; it does so based on the abstract notion of a **<em>Resource Container</em> **which incorporates resource elements such as memory, cpu, disk, network etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-hadoop-yarn-nodemanager/">NodeManager</a> is the per-machine slave, which is responsible for launching the applications’ containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager.</p>

<p>The per-application ApplicationMaster has the responsibility of negotiating appropriate resource containers from the Scheduler, tracking their status and monitoring for progress. From the system perspective, the ApplicationMaster itself runs as a normal <em>container</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an architectural view of YARN:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/MapR_3.png" alt="MapR_3" /></p>

<p>One of the crucial implementation details for MapReduce within the new YARN <strong>system</strong> that I’d like to point out is that we have reused the existing MapReduce <strong>framework</strong> without any major surgery. This was very important to ensure <strong>compatibility</strong> for existing MapReduce applications and users. Here is a short video introduction for YARN</p>

<h3 id="introduction-apache-hive"><strong>Introduction: Apache Hive</strong></h3>

<p>Hive is a SQL like query language that enables analysts familiar with SQL to run queries on large volumes of data.  Hive has three main functions: data summarization, query and analysis. Hive provides tools that enable easy data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL).</p>

<p><strong>Goals of the module</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding Apache Hive</li>
  <li>Understanding Apache Tez</li>
  <li>Understanding Ambari Hiver User Views on Hortonworks Sandbox</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hive.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Hive</strong></a><strong>™:</strong></p>

<p>Data analysts use Hive to explore, structure and analyze that data, then turn it into business insight. Hive implements a dialect of SQL (Hive QL) that focuses on analytics and presents a rich set of SQL semantics including OLAP functions, sub-queries, common table expressions and more. Hive allows SQL<br />
developers or users with SQL tools to easily query, analyze and process data stored in Hadoop.Hive also allows programmers familiar with the MapReduce framework to plug in their custom mappers and reducers to perform more sophisticated analysis that may not be supported by the built-in capabilities of the language.</p>

<p>Hive users have a choice of 3 runtimes when <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/5-ways-make-hive-queries-run-faster/">executing SQL queries</a>. Users can choose between Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Tez or<br />
Apache Spark frameworks as their execution backend</p>

<p>Here are some advantageous characteristics of Hive for enterprise SQL in Hadoop:</p>

      <td>As data variety and volume grows, more commodity machines can be added, without a corresponding reduction in performance</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>How Hive Works</strong></p>

<p>The tables in Hive are similar to tables in a relational database, and data units are organized in a taxonomy from larger to more granular units. Databases are comprised of tables, which are made up of partitions. Data can be accessed via a simple query language and Hive supports overwriting or appending data.</p>

<p>Within a particular database, data in the tables is serialized and each table has a corresponding Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) directory. Each table can be sub-divided into partitions that determine how data is distributed within sub-directories of the table directory. Data within partitions can be further broken down into buckets.</p>

<p><strong>Components of Hive</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog"><strong>HCatalog</strong></a> is a component of Hive. It is a table and storage management layer for Hadoop that enables users with different data processing tools — including Pig and MapReduce — to more easily read and write data on the grid. HCatalog holds a set of files paths and metadata about data in a Hadoop cluster. This allows scripts, MapReduce and Tez, jobs to be decoupled from data location and metadata like the schema. Additionally, since HCatalog also supports tools like Hive and Pig, the location and metadata can be shared between tools. Using the open APIs of HCatalog external tools that want to integrate, such as Teradata Aster, can also use leverage file path location and metadata in HCatalog.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>At one point HCatalog was its own Apache project. However, in March, 2013, <a href="https://hive.apache.org/hcatalog_downloads.html">HCatalog’s project merged</a> with Hive.  HCatalog is currently released as part of Hive.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat"><strong>WebHCat</strong></a> provides a service that you can use to run Hadoop MapReduce (or YARN), Pig, Hive jobs or perform Hive metadata operations using an HTTP (REST style) interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a short video introduction on Hive:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pn7Sp2-hUXE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" id="player4"></iframe>

<p><a href="https://tez.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Tez</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>Apache™ Tez is an extensible framework for building high performance batch and interactive data processing applications, coordinated by YARN in Apache Hadoop. Tez improves the MapReduce paradigm by dramatically improving its speed, while maintaining MapReduce’s ability to scale to petabytes of data. Important Hadoop ecosystem projects like Apache Hive and Apache Pig use Apache Tez, as do a growing number of third party data access applications developed for the broader Hadoop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Apache Tez provides a developer API and framework to write native <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/yarn/">YARN</a> applications that bridge the spectrum of interactive and batch workloads. It allows those data access applications to work with petabytes of data over thousands nodes. The Apache Tez component library allows developers to create Hadoop applications that integrate natively with Apache Hadoop YARN and perform well within mixed workload clusters.</p>

<p>Since Tez is extensible and embeddable, it provides the fit-to-purpose freedom to express highly optimized data processing applications, giving them an advantage over end-user-facing engines such as <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/mapreduce/">MapReduce</a> and <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/spark/">Apache Spark</a>. Tez also offers a customizable execution architecture that allows users to express complex computations as dataflow graphs, permitting dynamic performance optimizations based on real information about the data and the resources required to process it.</p>

<h3 id="stinger-and-stingernext"><strong>Stinger and Stinger.next</strong></h3>

<p>The Stinger Initiative was started to enable Hive to support an even broader range of use cases at truly Big Data scale: bringing it beyond its Batch roots to support interactive queries – all with a common SQL access layer.</p>

<p>Stinger.next is a continuation of this initiative focused on even further enhancing the <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/benchmarking-apache-hive-13-enterprise-hadoop/">speed</a>, scale and breadth of SQL support to enable truly real-time access in Hive while also bringing support for transactional capabilities.  And just as the original Stinger initiative did, this will be addressed through a familiar three-phase delivery schedule and developed completely in the open Apache Hive community.</p>

<p><strong>Ambari Hive User Views on Hortonworks Sandbox</strong></p>

<p>To make it easy to interact with Hive we use a tool in the Hortonworks Sandbox called the Ambari Hive User View.   Ambari Hive User View provides an interactive interface to Hive.   We can create, edit, save and run queries, and have Hive evaluate them for us using a series of MapReduce jobs or Tez jobs.</p>

<p>Let’s now open the Ambari Hive User View and get introduced to the environment, go to the Ambari User VIew icon and select Hive :</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Screen-Shot-2015-07-21-at-10.10.18-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-21 at 10.10.18 AM" /></p>

<p>Ambari Hive User View</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Hive_6.png" alt="Hive_6" /></p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the SQL editing capabilities in the User View:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are four tabs to interact with SQL:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Query</strong>: This is the interface shown above and the primary interface to write, edit and execute new SQL statements</li>
      <li><strong>Saved Queries</strong>: You can save your favorite queries and quickly have access to them to rerun or edit.</li>
      <li><strong>History</strong>: This allows you to look at past queries or currently running queries to view, edit and rerun.  It also allows you to see all SQL queries you have authority to view.  For example, if you are an operator and an analyst needs help with a query, then the Hadoop operator can use the History feature to see the query that was sent from the reporting tool.</li>
      <li><strong>UDF</strong>s:  Allows you to define UDF interfaces and associated classes so you can access them from the SQL editor.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Database Explorer:</strong>  The Database Explorer helps you navigate your database objects.  You can either search for a database object in the Search tables dialog box, or you can navigate through Database -&gt; Table -&gt; Columns in the navigation pane.</li>
  <li>The principle pane to write and edit SQL statements. This editor includes content assist via <strong>CTRL + Space</strong> to help you build queries. Content assist helps you with SQL syntax and table objects.</li>
  <li>Once you have created your SQL statement you have 3 options:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Execute</strong>: This runs the SQL statement.</li>
      <li><strong>Explain</strong>: This provides you a visual plan, from the Hive optimizer, of how the SQL statement will be executed.</li>
      <li><strong>Save as</strong>:  Allows you to persist your queries into your list of saved queries.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When the query is executed you can see the Logs or the actual query results.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Logs:</strong> When the query is executed you can see the logs associated with the query execution.  If your query fails this is a good place to get additional information for troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Results</strong>: You can view results in sets of 50 by default.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>There are four sliding views on the right hand side with the following capabilities, which are in context of the tab you are in:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Query</strong>: This is the default operation,which allows you to write and edit SQL.</li>
      <li><strong>Settings</strong>:  This allows you to set properties globally or associated with an individual query.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Explain</strong>: This will generate an explain for the query.  This will also show the progress of the query.</li>
      <li><strong>TEZ</strong>: If you use TEZ as the query execution engine then you can view the DAG associated with the query.  This integrates the TEZ User View so you can check for correctness and helps with performance tuning by visualizing the TEZ jobs associated with a SQL query.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: This is how to get feedback on query execution.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Apache Hive project provides a data warehouse view of the data in HDFS. Using a SQL dialect, <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual">HiveQL</a> (HQL), Hive lets you create summarizations of your data and perform ad-hoc queries and analysis of large datasets in the Hadoop cluster. The overall approach with Hive is to project a table structure on the dataset and then manipulate it with SQL.   The notion of projecting a table structure on a file is often referred to as <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/hivehcatalog-data-geeks-big-data-glue/">Schema-On-Read</a>.   Since you are using data in HDFS, your operations can be scaled across all the datanodes and you can manipulate huge datasets.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-apache-pig"><strong>Introduction: Apache Pig</strong></h3>

<p>MapReduce allows allows you to specify map and reduce functions, but working out how to fit your data processing into this pattern may sometimes require you to write multiple MapReduce stages. With Pig, data structures are much richer and the transformations you can apply to data are much more powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Goals of this Module</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding Apache Pig</li>
  <li>Understanding Apache Pig on Tez</li>
  <li>Understanding Ambari Pig User Views on Hortonworks Sandbox</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://pig.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Pig</strong></a><strong>™</strong></p>

<p>Apache Pig allows Apache Hadoop users to write complex MapReduce transformations using a simple scripting language called Pig Latin. Pig translates the Pig Latin script into MapReduce so that it can be executed within YARN for access to a single dataset stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).</p>

<p>Pig was designed for performing a long series of data operations, making it ideal for three categories of Big Data jobs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extract-transform-load (ETL)</strong> data pipelines,</li>
  <li><strong>Research</strong> on raw data, and</li>
  <li><strong>Iterative data processing.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the use case, Pig will be:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Characteristic</th>
      <th>Benefit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Extensible</td>
      <td>Pig users can create custom functions to meet their particular processing requirements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Easily Programmed</td>
      <td>Complex tasks involving interrelated data transformations can be simplified and encoded as data flow sequences. Pig programs accomplish huge tasks, but they are easy to write and maintain.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Self-Optimizing</td>
      <td>Because the system automatically optimizes execution of Pig jobs, the user can focus on semantics.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Please refer the following video on Pig for more clarity:</p>

<p><strong>How Pig Works</strong></p>

<p>Pig runs on Apache Hadoop YARN and makes use of MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The language for the platform is called Pig Latin, which abstracts from the Java MapReduce idiom into a form similar to SQL. While SQL is designed to query the data, Pig Latin allows you to write a data flow that describes how your data will be transformed (such as aggregate, join and sort).</p>

<p>Since Pig Latin scripts can be graphs (instead of requiring a single output) it is possible to build complex data flows involving multiple inputs, transforms, and outputs. Users can extend Pig Latin by writing their own functions, using Java, Python, Ruby, or other scripting languages. Pig Latin is sometimes extended using UDFs (User Defined Functions), which the user can write in any of those languages and then call directly from the Pig Latin.</p>

<p>The user can run Pig in two modes, using either the “pig” command or the “java” command:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MapReduce Mode.</strong> This is the default mode, which requires access to a Hadoop cluster. The cluster may be a pseudo- or fully distributed one.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Mode.</strong> With access to a single machine, all files are installed and run using a local host and file system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ambari Pig User Views on Hortonworks Sandbox</strong>:</p>

<p>To get to the Ambari Pig User View on Sandbox, click on the User Views icon at top right and select <strong>Pig</strong>:</p>

<p>This will bring up the Ambari Pig User View interface. Your Pig View does not have any scripts to display, so it will look like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Pig_2.png" alt="Pig_2" /></p>

<p>On the left is a list of your scripts, and on the right is a composition box for writing scripts. A special feature of the interface is the Pig helper at the bottom. The Pig helper will provide us with templates for the statements, functions, I/O statements, HCatLoader() and Python user defined functions. At the very bottom are status areas that will show the results of our script and log files.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows and describes the various components and features of the Pig User View:</p>

<h3 id="start-the-sandbox-vm-and-open-ambari"><strong>Start the Sandbox VM and Open Ambari</strong></h3>

<p>Start the HDP Sandbox following the <a href="http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#install">Sandbox Install Guide</a> to start the VM:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab0_1.png" alt="Lab0_1" /></p>

<p>Once you have installed the Sandbox VM, it resolves to the host on your environment, the address of which varies depending upon the Virtual Machine you are using(Vmware, VirtualBox etc). As, a general thumb rule, wait for the installation to complete and confirmation screen will tell you the host your sandbox resolves to. For example:</p>

<p>In case of VirtualBox: host would be 127.0.0.1</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab0_2.png" alt="Lab0_2" /></p>

<p>If you are using a private cluster or a cloud to run sandbox. Please find the host your sandbox resolves to.</p>

<p>Append the port number :8888 to your host address, open your browser, and access Sandbox Welcome page at http://<em>host</em>:8888/.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-6.11.32-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 6.11.32 PM" /></p>

<p>Navigate to Ambari welcome page using the url given on Sandbox welcome page.</p>

<p><strong>Both the username and password to login are admin.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to search for the host address your sandbox is running on, ssh into the sandbox terminal upon successful installation and follow subsequent steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>login using username as “root” and password as “hadoop”.</li>
  <li>Type ifconfig and look for inet address under eth.</li>
  <li>Use the inet address, append :8080 and open it into a browser. It shall direct you to Ambari login page.</li>
  <li>This inet address is randomly generated for every session and therefore differs from session to session.</li>

<h3 id="loading-sensor-data-into-hdfs"><strong>Loading Sensor Data into HDFS</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>In this section you will download the sensor data and load that into HDFS using Ambari User Views. You will get introduced to the Ambari Files User View to manage files. You can perform tasks like create directories, navigate file systems and upload files to HDFS.  In addition you’ll perform a few other file-related tasks as well.  Once you get the basics, you will create two directories and then load two files into HDFS using the Ambari Files User View.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>

<p>The tutorial is a part of series of hands on tutorial to get you started on HDP using Hortonworks sandbox. Please ensure you complete the prerequisites before proceeding with this tutorial.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lab 0: (Hortonworks sandbox set up)</li>
  <li>Allow yourself around half an hour to complete this tutorial.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Step 1.2: Load Data into HDFS</li>
  <li>Suggested readings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HDFS backdrop:</strong></p>

<p>A single physical machine gets saturated with its storage capacity as the data grows. Thereby comes impending need to partition your data across separate machines. This type of File system that manages storage of data across a network of machines is called Distributed File Systems. <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/thinking-about-the-hdfs-vs-other-storage-technologies/">HDFS</a> is a core component of Apache Hadoop and is designed to store large files with streaming data access patterns, running on clusters of commodity hardware. With Hortonworks Data Platform HDP 2.2, HDFS is now expanded to support <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/heterogeneous-storage-policies-hdp-2-2/">heterogeneous storage</a>  media within the HDFS cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.1: Download and Extract the Sensor Data Files</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can download the sample sensor data contained in a compressed (.zip) folder here:  <a href="https://app.box.com/HadoopCrashCourseData"><strong>Geolocation.zip</strong></a></li>
  <li>Save the Geolocation.zip file to your computer, then extract the files. You should see a Geolocation folder that contains the following files:
    <ul>
      <li>geolocation.csv – This is the collected geolocation data from the trucks. it contains records showing truck location, date, time, type of event, speed, etc.</li>
      <li>trucks.csv – This is data was exported from a relational database and it shows info on truck model, driverid, truckid, and aggregated mileage info.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 1.2: Load the Sensor Data into HDFS</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to the Ambari Dashboard and open the HDFS User View by click on the User Views icon and selecting the HDFS Files menu item.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Starting from the top root of the HDFS file system, you will see all the files the logged in user (admin in this case) has access to see:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_2.png" alt="Lab2_2" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click tmp. Then click  <img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_3.png" alt="Lab2_3" /> button to create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/admin</code> directory and then create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/admin/data</code> directory.</li>

<h3 id="data-manipulation-with-hive"><strong>Data manipulation with Hive</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>In this section of tutorial you will be introduced to Apache Hive. In the earlier section we covered how to load data into HDFS. So now you have ‘geolocation’ and ‘trucks’ files stored in HDFS as csv files. In order to use this data in Hive we will tell you how to create a table and how to move data into Hive warehouse, from where it can be queried upon. We will analyze this data using SQL queries in Hive User Views and store it as ORC. We will also walk through Apache Tez and how a DAG is created when you specify Tez as execution engine for Hive. Lets start..!!</p>

<p>The tutorial is a part of series of hands on tutorial to get you started on HDP using Hortonworks sandbox. Please ensure you complete the prerequisites before proceeding with this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="hive">Hive</h3>

<p>Hive is a SQL like query language that enables analysts familiar with SQL to run queries on large volumes of data.  Hive has three main functions: data summarization, query and analysis. Hive provides tools that enable easy data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL).</p>

<h4 id="step-21-become-familiar-with-ambari-hive-user-view"><strong>Step 2.1: Become Familiar with Ambari Hive User View</strong></h4>

<p>Apache Hive™ presents a relational view of data in HDFS and ensures that users need not worry about where or in what format their data is stored.  Hive can display data from RCFile format, text files, ORC, JSON, parquet,  sequence files and many of other formats in a tabular view.   Through the use of SQL you can view your data as a table and create queries like you would in an RDBMS.</p>

<p>To make it easy to interact with Hive we use a tool in the Hortonworks Sandbox called the Ambari Hive User View.   Ambari Hive User View provides an interactive interface to Hive.   We can create, edit, save and run queries, and have Hive evaluate them for us using a series of MapReduce jobs or Tez jobs.</p>

<p>Let’s now open the Ambari Hive User View and get introduced to the environment, go to the Ambari User VIew icon and select Hive :</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Screen-Shot-2015-07-21-at-10.10.18-AM-300x208.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-21 at 10.10.18 AM" /></p>

<p>The Ambari Hive User View looks like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_21.png" alt="Lab2_2" /></p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the SQL editing capabilities in the User View:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are four tabs to interact with SQL:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Query</strong>: This is the interface shown above and the primary interface to write, edit and execute new SQL statements</li>
      <li><strong>Saved Queries</strong>: You can save your favorite queries and quickly have access to them to rerun or edit.</li>
      <li><strong>History</strong>: This allows you to look at past queries or currently running queries to view, edit and rerun.  It also allows you to see all SQL queries you have authority to view.  For example, if you are an operator and an analyst needs help with a query, then the Hadoop operator can use the History feature to see the query that was sent from the reporting tool.</li>
      <li><strong>UDF</strong>s:  Allows you to define UDF interfaces and associated classes so you can access them from the SQL editor.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Database Explorer:</strong>  The Database Explorer helps you navigate your database objects.  You can either search for a database object in the Search tables dialog box, or you can navigate through Database -&gt; Table -&gt; Columns in the navigation pane.</li>
  <li>The principle pane to write and edit SQL statements. This editor includes content assist via <strong>CTRL + Space</strong> to help you build queries. Content assist helps you with SQL syntax and table objects.</li>
  <li>Once you have created your SQL statement you have 3 options:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Execute</strong>: This runs the SQL statement.</li>
      <li><strong>Explain</strong>: This provides you a visual plan, from the Hive optimizer, of how the SQL statement will be executed.</li>
      <li><strong>Save as</strong>:  Allows you to persist your queries into your list of saved queries.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When the query is executed you can see the Logs or the actual query results.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Logs:</strong> When the query is executed you can see the logs associated with the query execution.  If your query fails this is a good place to get additional information for troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Results</strong>: You can view results in sets of 50 by default.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>There are four sliding views on the right hand side with the following capabilities, which are in context of the tab you are in:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Query</strong>: This is the default operation,which allows you to write and edit SQL.</li>
      <li><strong>Settings</strong>:  This allows you to set properties globally or associated with an individual query.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Explain</strong>: This will generate an explain for the query.  This will also show the progress of the query.</li>
      <li><strong>TEZ</strong>: If you use TEZ as the query execution engine then you can view the DAG associated with the query.  This integrates the TEZ User View so you can check for correctness and helps with performance tuning by visualizing the TEZ jobs associated with a SQL query.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: This is how to get feedback on query execution.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Take a few minutes to explore the various Hive User View features.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.2: Define a Hive Table</strong></p>

<p>Now that you are familiar with the Hive User View, let’s create the initial staging tables for the geolocation and trucks data. In this section we will learn how to use the Ambari Hive User View to create four tables: geolocaiton_stage, trucking_stage, geolocation, trucking.  First we are going to create 2 tables to stage the data in their original csv text format and then will create two more tables where we will optimize the storage with ORC. Here is a visual representation of the Data Flow:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_31.png" alt="Lab2_3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy-and-paste the the following table DDL into the empty <strong>Worksheet</strong> of the <strong>Query Editor</strong> to define a new table named geolocation_staging:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table geolocation for staging initial load</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE geolocation_stage (truckid string, driverid string, event string, latitude DOUBLE, longitude DOUBLE, city string, state string, velocity BIGINT, event_ind BIGINT, idling_ind BIGINT) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
STORED AS TEXTFILE
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li> Click the green <strong>Execute</strong> button to run the command. If successful, you should see the <strong>Succeeded</strong> status in the <strong>Query Process Results</strong> section:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_41.png" alt="Lab2_4" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Create a new Worksheet by clicking the blue <strong>New Worksheet</strong> button:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_51.png" alt="Lab2_5" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Notice the tab of your new Worksheet is labeled “Worksheet (1)”. Double-click on this tab to rename the label to “trucks_stage”:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_6.png" alt="Lab2_6" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Copy-and-paste the following table DDL into your <strong>trucks_stage</strong> worksheet to define a new table named trucks_stage:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table trucks for staging initial load</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE trucks_stage(driverid string, truckid string, model string, jun13_miles bigint, jun13_gas bigint, may13_miles bigint, may13_gas bigint, apr13_miles bigint, apr13_gas bigint, mar13_miles bigint, mar13_gas bigint, feb13_miles bigint, feb13_gas bigint, jan13_miles bigint, jan13_gas bigint, dec12_miles bigint, dec12_gas bigint, nov12_miles bigint, nov12_gas bigint, oct12_miles bigint, oct12_gas bigint, sep12_miles bigint, sep12_gas bigint, aug12_miles bigint, aug12_gas bigint, jul12_miles bigint, jul12_gas bigint, jun12_miles bigint, jun12_gas bigint,may12_miles bigint, may12_gas bigint, apr12_miles bigint, apr12_gas bigint, mar12_miles bigint, mar12_gas bigint, feb12_miles bigint, feb12_gas bigint, jan12_miles bigint, jan12_gas bigint, dec11_miles bigint, dec11_gas bigint, nov11_miles bigint, nov11_gas bigint, oct11_miles bigint, oct11_gas bigint, sep11_miles bigint, sep11_gas bigint, aug11_miles bigint, aug11_gas bigint, jul11_miles bigint, jul11_gas bigint, jun11_miles bigint, jun11_gas bigint, may11_miles bigint, may11_gas bigint, apr11_miles bigint, apr11_gas bigint, mar11_miles bigint, mar11_gas bigint, feb11_miles bigint, feb11_gas bigint, jan11_miles bigint, jan11_gas bigint, dec10_miles bigint, dec10_gas bigint, nov10_miles bigint, nov10_gas bigint, oct10_miles bigint, oct10_gas bigint, sep10_miles bigint, sep10_gas bigint, aug10_miles bigint, aug10_gas bigint, jul10_miles bigint, jul10_gas bigint, jun10_miles bigint, jun10_gas bigint, may10_miles bigint, may10_gas bigint, apr10_miles bigint, apr10_gas bigint, mar10_miles bigint, mar10_gas bigint, feb10_miles bigint, feb10_gas bigint, jan10_miles bigint, jan10_gas bigint, dec09_miles bigint, dec09_gas bigint, nov09_miles bigint, nov09_gas bigint, oct09_miles bigint, oct09_gas bigint, sep09_miles bigint, sep09_gas bigint, aug09_miles bigint, aug09_gas bigint, jul09_miles bigint, jul09_gas bigint, jun09_miles bigint, jun09_gas bigint, may09_miles bigint, may09_gas bigint, apr09_miles bigint, apr09_gas bigint, mar09_miles bigint, mar09_gas bigint, feb09_miles bigint, feb09_gas bigint, jan09_miles bigint, jan09_gas bigint)

</div>

<ol>
  <li> Execute the query and make sure it runs successfully.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s review some aspects of the CREATE TABLE statements issued above.  If you have a SQL background this statement should seem very familiar except for the last 3 lines after the columns definition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ROW FORMAT clause specifies each row is terminated by the new line character.</li>
  <li>The FIELDS TERMINATED BY clause specifies that the fields associated with the table (in our case, the two csv files) are to be delimited by a comma.</li>
  <li>The STORED AS clause specifies that the table will be stored in the TEXTFILE format.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details on these clauses consult the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL">Apache Hive Language Manual</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li> To verify the tables were defined successfully, click the “refresh” icon in the Database Explorer. Under Databases, click default database to expand the list of table and the new tables should appear:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_7.png" alt="Lab2_7" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Click on the trucks_stage table name to view its schema.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Click on the <strong>Load sample data</strong> icon to generate and execute a select SQL statement to query the table for a 100 rows. Notice your two new tables are currently empty.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can have multiple SQL statements within each editor worksheet, but each statement needs to be separated by a semicolon “;”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have multiple statements within a worksheet but you only want to run one of them just highlight the statement you want ran and then click the Execute button.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few additional commands to explore tables:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">show tables;</code> List the tables created in the database by looking up the list of tables from the metadata stored in HCatalogdescribe _
-<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">table_name</span><span class="p">}</span></code>;Provides a list of columns for a particular table (ie <code class="highlighter-rouge">describe geolocation_stage;</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">show create {table_name};</code>Provides the DDL to recreate a table (ie <code class="highlighter-rouge">show create table geolocation_stage;</code>)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> By default, when you create a table in Hive, a directory with the same name gets created in the /apps/hive/warehouse folder in HDFS.  Using the Ambari Files User View, navigate to the /apps/hive/warehouse folder. You should see both a geolocation_stage and trucks_stage directory:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_8.png" alt="Lab2_8" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The definition of a Hive table and its associated metadata (i.e., the directory the data is stored in, the file format, what Hive properties are set, etc.) are stored in the Hive metastore, which on the Sandbox is a MySQL database.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2.3: Load Data into a Hive table</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Let’s load some data into your two Hive tables. Populating a Hive table can be done in various ways. A simple way to populate a table is to put a file into the directory associated with the table. Using the Ambari Files User View, click on the <strong>Move</strong> icon next to the file /tmp/admin/data/geolocation.csv. (Clicking on <strong>Move</strong> is similar to “cut” in cut-and-paste.)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-9.45.11-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-27 at 9.45.11 PM" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> After clicking on the <strong>Move</strong> arrow your screen should look like the following:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_10.png" alt="Lab2_10" /></p>

<p>Notice two things have changed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The file name geolocation.csv has grayed out some</li>
  <li>The icons associated with the operations on the files are removed. This is to indicate that this file is in a special state that is ready to be moved.</li>
  <li>Now navigate to the destination path /apps/hive/warehouse/geolocation_stage.  You might notice that as you navigate through the directories that the file is pinned at the top.  Once you get to the appropriate directory click on the <strong>Paste</strong> icon to move the file:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_111.png" alt="Lab2_11" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Go back to the Ambari Hive View and click on the <strong>Load sample data</strong> icon next to the geolocation_stage table. Notice the table is no longer empty, and you should see the first 100 rows of the table:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_12.png" alt="Lab2_12" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Enter the following SQL command into an empty Worksheet in the Ambari Hive User View:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>LOAD DATA INPATH '/tmp/admin/data/trucks.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE trucks_stage;
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li> You should now see data in the trucks_stage table:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_13.png" alt="Lab2_13" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> From the Files view, navigate to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/admin/data</code> folder. Notice the folder is empty! The LOAD DATA INPATH command moved the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trucks.csv</code> file from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/admin/data</code> folder to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/apps/hive/warehouse/trucks_stage</code> folder.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Step 2.4: Define an ORC Table in Hive</strong></p>

<h4 id="introducing-apache-orc"><strong>Introducing</strong> <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+ORC"><strong>Apache ORC</strong></a></h4>

<p>The Optimized Row Columnar (<a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/apache-orc-launches-as-a-top-level-project/">new Apache ORC project</a>) file format provides a highly efficient way to store Hive data. It was designed to overcome limitations of the other Hive file formats. Using ORC files improves performance when Hive is reading, writing, and processing data.</p>

<p>To use the ORC format, specify ORC as the file format when creating the table:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">CREATE TABLE … **STORED AS ORC**</code></p>

<p>In this step, you will create two ORC tables (geolocation and trucks) that are created from the text data in your geolocation_stage and trucks_stage tables.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the Ambari Hive User View, execute the following table DDL to define a new table named geolocation:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table geolocation as ORC from geolocation_stage table</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE geolocation STORED AS ORC AS SELECT * FROM geolocation_stage;
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li> Refresh the <strong>Database Explorer</strong> and verify you have a table named geolocation in the default database:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_14.png" alt="Lab2_14" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> View the contents of the geolocation table. Notice it contains the same rows as geolocation_stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> To verify geolocation is an ORC table, execute the following query:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>describe formatted geolocation;</p>

<ol>
  <li> Scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Results</strong> tab and you will see a section labeled <strong>Storage Information</strong>. The output should look like:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_15.png" alt="Lab2_15" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Execute the following query to define a new ORC table named trucks that contains the data from trucks_stage:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table trucks as ORC from trucks_stage table</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE trucks STORED AS ORC TBLPROPERTIES ("orc.compress.size"="1024") AS SELECT * FROM trucks_stage;
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li> Verify that the table has been properly created by refreshing the <strong>Database Explorer</strong> and viewing the contents of trucks:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_16.png" alt="Lab2_16" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to try running some of these commands from the Hive Shell follow the following steps from your terminal shell (or putty if using Windows):</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222</code>
Root password is hadoop</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">su hive</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">hive</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Starts Hive shell and now you can enter commands and SQL</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">quit;</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Exits out of the Hive shell.</p>

<h4 id="step-25-review-hive-settings">Step 2.5: Review Hive Settings</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Ambari Dashboard in another tab by right clicking on the Ambari icon</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_17.png" alt="Lab2_17" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Go to the <strong>Hive page</strong> then select the <strong>Configs tab</strong> then click on <strong>Settings tab</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_18.png" alt="Lab2_18" /></p>

<p>Once you click on the Hive page you should see a page similar to above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hive Page</li>
  <li>Hive Configs Tab</li>
  <li>Hive Settings Tab</li>
  <li>Version History of Configuration</li>
</ol>

<p>Scroll down to the Optimization Settings:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_19.png" alt="Lab2_19" /><br />
In the above screenshot we can see:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tez is set as the optimization engine</li>
  <li>Cost Based Optimizer (CBO) is turned on</li>
</ol>

<p>This shows the new HDP 2.3 Ambari Smart Configurations, which simplifies setting configurations</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hadoop is configured by a collection of XML files.</li>
  <li>In early versions of Hadoop operators would need to do XML editing to change settings.  There was no default versioning.</li>
  <li>Early Ambari interfaces made it easier to change values by showing the settings page with dialog boxes for the various settings and allowing you to edit them.  However, you needed to know what needed to go into the field and understand the range of values.</li>
  <li>Now with Smart Configurations you can toggle binary features and use the slider bars with settings that have ranges.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default the key configurations are displayed on the first page.  If the setting you are looking for is not on this page you can find additional settings in the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_20.png" alt="Lab2_20" /></p>

<p>For example, what if we wanted to improve SQL performance by using the new Hive vectorization features, where would we find the setting and how would we turn it on.   You would need to do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and scroll to find the property</li>
  <li>Or, start typing in the property into the property search field and then this would filter the setting you scroll for.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see from the green circle above the hive.vectorized.execution.enabled is turned on already.</p>

<h4 id="step-26-analyze-the-trucks-data">Step 2.6: Analyze the Trucks Data</h4>

<p>Next we will be using Hive, Pig and Excel to analyze derived data from the geolocation and trucks tables.  The business objective is to better understand the risk the company is under from fatigue of drivers, over-used trucks, and the impact of various trucking events on risk.   In order to accomplish this we are going to apply a series of transformations to the source data, mostly though SQL, and use Pig to calculate risk.   In Step 10 we will be using Microsoft Excel to generate a series of charts to better understand risk.<br />
<img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab2_211.png" alt="Lab2_21" /></p>

<p>Let’s get started with the first transformation.   We want to calculate the miles per gallon for each truck. We will start with our truck data table.  We need to sum up all the miles and gas columns on a per truck basis. Hive has a series of functions that can be used to reformat a table. The keyword <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+LateralView">LATERAL VIEW</a> is how we invoke things. The stack function allows us to restructure the data into 3 columns labeled rdate, gas and mile with 54 rows. We pick truckid, driverid, rdate, miles, gas from our original table and add a calculated column for mpg (miles/gas).  And then we will calculate average mileage.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the Ambari Hive User View, execute the following query:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table truck_mileage from existing trucking data</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE truck_mileage STORED AS ORC AS SELECT truckid, driverid, rdate, miles, gas, miles / gas mpg FROM trucks LATERAL VIEW stack(54, 'jun13',jun13_miles,jun13_gas,'may13',may13_miles,may13_gas,'apr13',apr13_miles,apr13_gas,'mar13',mar13_miles,mar13_gas,'feb13',feb13_miles,feb13_gas,'jan13',jan13_miles,jan13_gas,'dec12',dec12_miles,dec12_gas,'nov12',nov12_miles,nov12_gas,'oct12',oct12_miles,oct12_gas,'sep12',sep12_miles,sep12_gas,'aug12',aug12_miles,aug12_gas,'jul12',jul12_miles,jul12_gas,'jun12',jun12_miles,jun12_gas,'may12',may12_miles,may12_gas,'apr12',apr12_miles,apr12_gas,'mar12',mar12_miles,mar12_gas,'feb12',feb12_miles,feb12_gas,'jan12',jan12_miles,jan12_gas,'dec11',dec11_miles,dec11_gas,'nov11',nov11_miles,nov11_gas,'oct11',oct11_miles,oct11_gas,'sep11',sep11_miles,sep11_gas,'aug11',aug11_miles,aug11_gas,'jul11',jul11_miles,jul11_gas,'jun11',jun11_miles,jun11_gas,'may11',may11_miles,may11_gas,'apr11',apr11_miles,apr11_gas,'mar11',mar11_miles,mar11_gas,'feb11',feb11_miles,feb11_gas,'jan11',jan11_miles,jan11_gas,'dec10',dec10_miles,dec10_gas,'nov10',nov10_miles,nov10_gas,'oct10',oct10_miles,oct10_gas,'sep10',sep10_miles,sep10_gas,'aug10',aug10_miles,aug10_gas,'jul10',jul10_miles,jul10_gas,'jun10',jun10_miles,jun10_gas,'may10',may10_miles,may10_gas,'apr10',apr10_miles,apr10_gas,'mar10',mar10_miles,mar10_gas,'feb10',feb10_miles,feb10_gas,'jan10',jan10_miles,jan10_gas,'dec09',dec09_miles,dec09_gas,'nov09',nov09_miles,nov09_gas,'oct09',oct09_miles,oct09_gas,'sep09',sep09_miles,sep09_gas,'aug09',aug09_miles,aug09_gas,'jul09',jul09_miles,jul09_gas,'jun09',jun09_miles,jun09_gas,'may09',may09_miles,may09_gas,'apr09',apr09_miles,apr09_gas,'mar09',mar09_miles,mar09_gas,'feb09',feb09_miles,feb09_gas,'jan09',jan09_miles,jan09_gas ) dummyalias AS rdate, miles, gas;

<h2 id="lab-3-pig---risk-factor">Lab 3: Pig - Risk Factor</h2>

<h3 id="use-pig-to-compute-driver-risk-factor"><strong>Use Pig to compute Driver Risk Factor</strong></h3>

<h4 id="introduction-4"><strong>Introduction:</strong></h4>

<p>In this tutorial you will be introduced to Apache Pig. In the earlier section of lab you learned how to load data into HDFS and then manipulate it using Hive. We are using the Truck sensor data to better understand  risk associated with every driver. This section will teach you to compute risk using Apache Pig.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>

<p>The tutorial is a part of series of hands on tutorial to get you started on HDP using Hortonworks sandbox. Please ensure you complete the prerequisites before proceeding with this tutorial.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lab 0: (Hortonworks sandbox set up)</li>

  <li>Suggested readings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pig Basics:</strong></p>

<p>Pig is a high level scripting language that is used with Apache Hadoop. Pig enables data workers to write complex data transformations without knowing Java. Pig’s simple SQL-like scripting language is called Pig Latin, and appeals to developers already familiar with scripting languages and SQL.</p>

<p>Pig is complete, so you can do all required data manipulations in Apache Hadoop with Pig. Through the User Defined Functions(UDF) facility in Pig, Pig can invoke code in many languages like JRuby, Jython and Java. You can also embed Pig scripts in other languages. The result is that you can use Pig as a component to build larger and more complex applications that tackle real business problems.</p>

<p>Pig works with data from many sources, including structured and unstructured data, and store the results into the Hadoop Data File System.</p>

<p>Pig scripts are translated into a series of MapReduce jobs that are run on the Apache Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.1: Define table schema</strong></p>

<p>Now we have refined the truck data to get the average mpg  for each truck. The next task is to compute the risk factor for each driver which is the total miles driven/abnormal events. We can get the event information from the geolocation table.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_1.png" alt="Lab3_1" /></p>

<p>If we look at the truck_mileage table, we we have the driverid and the number of miles for each trip. To get the total miles for each driver, we can group those records by driverid and then sum the miles.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We will start by creating a table named driver_mileage that is created from a query of the columns we want from truck_mileage. The following query groups the records by driverid and sums the miles in the select statement. Execute this query in a new Worksheet:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table DriverMileage from existing truck_mileage data</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE DriverMileage
STORED AS ORC
AS
SELECT driverid, sum(miles) totmiles
FROM truck_mileage
GROUP BY driverid;
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>View the data generated by the script by clicking the <strong>Load sample data</strong> icon in the Database Explorer next to drivermileage. The results should look like:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_2.png" alt="Lab3_2" /></p>

<p>3. Next, you will use Pig to compute the risk factor of each driver. Before we can run the Pig code, one of the requirements for the HCatStorer() class is that the table must already exist in Hive. The Pig code expects the following structure for a table named riskfactor. Execute the following DDL command:</p>

<p><strong>Create table avg_mileage from existing trucks_mileage data</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE riskfactor (driverid string,events bigint,totmiles bigint,riskfactor float)
STORED AS ORC;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>4. Verify the riskfactor table was created successfully. It will be empty now, but you will populate it from a Pig script. You are now ready to compute the risk factor using Pig. Let’s take a look at Pig and how to execute Pig scripts from within Ambari.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.2: Create Pig Script</strong></p>

<p>In this tutorial we create and run a Pig script. We will use the Ambari Pig User View. Let’s get started…</p>

<h4 id="1-log-in-to-ambari-pig-user-views">1. Log in to Ambari Pig User Views</h4>

<p>To get to the Ambari Pig User View, click on the User Views icon at top right and select <strong>Pig</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Screen-Shot-2015-07-21-at-10.12.41-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-07-21 at 10.12.41 AM" /><br />
This will bring up the Ambari Pig User View interface. Your Pig View does not have any scripts to display, so it will look like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_4.png" alt="Lab3_4" /></p>

<p>On the left is a list of your scripts, and on the right is a composition box for writing scripts. A special feature of the interface is the Pig helper at the bottom. The Pig helper will provide us with templates for the statements, functions, I/O statements, HCatLoader() and Python user defined functions. At the very bottom are status areas that will show the results of our script and log files.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows and describes the various components and features of the Pig User View:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_5.png" alt="Lab3_5" /></p>

<h4 id="2-create-a-new-script">2. Create a New Script</h4>

<p>Let’s enter a Pig script. Click the <strong>New Script</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the view:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_6.png" alt="Lab3_6" /></p>

<p>Name the script <strong>riskfactor.pig</strong>, then click the <strong>Create</strong> button:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_7.png" alt="Lab3_7" /></p>

<h4 id="3-load-data-in-pig-using-hcatalog">3. Load Data in Pig using Hcatalog</h4>

<p>We are going to use HCatalog to load data into Pig. HCatalog allows us to share schema across tools and users within our Hadoop environment. It also allows us to factor out schema and location information from our queries and scripts and centralize them in a common repository. Since it is in HCatalog we can use the HCatLoader() function. Pig makes it easy by allowing us to give the table a name or alias and not have to worry about allocating space and defining the structure. We just have to worry about how we are processing the table.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can use the Pig helper at the bottom of the screen to give us a template for the line. Click on <strong>Pig helper -&gt; HCatalog-&gt;load template</strong></li>
  <li>The entry <strong>%TABLE%</strong> is highlighted in red for us. Type the name of the table which is geolocation.</li>
  <li>Remember to add the <strong>a =</strong> before the template. This saves the results into a. Note the <strong>‘=’</strong> has to have a space before and after it.</li>
  <li>Our completed line of code will look like:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>a = LOAD 'geolocation' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Copy-and-paste the above Pig code into the riskfactor.pig window.</p>

<h4 id="4-filter-your-data-set">4. Filter your data set</h4>

<p>The next step is to select a subset of the records so that we just have the records of drivers for which the event is not normal. To do this in Pig we use the Filter operator. We tell Pig to Filter our table and keep all records where event !=“normal” and store this in b. With this one simple statement Pig will look at each record in the table and filter out all the ones that do not meet our criteria.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can use Pig Help again by clicking on <strong>Pig helper-&gt;Relational Operators-&gt;FILTER template</strong></li>
  <li>We can replace <strong>%VAR%</strong> with <strong>“a”</strong> (hint: tab jumps you to the next field)</li>
  <li>Our <strong>%COND%</strong> is “<strong>event !=’normal’;</strong> ” (note: single quotes are needed around normal and don’t forget the trailing semi-colon)</li>
  <li>Complete line of code will look like:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>b = filter a by event != 'normal';
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Copy-and-paste the above Pig code into the riskfactor.pig window.</p>

<h4 id="5-iterate-your-data-set">5. Iterate your data set</h4>

<p>Now that we have the right set of records we can iterate through them. We use the “foreach” operator on the grouped data to iterate through all the records. We would also like to know how many times a driver has a non normal event associated with him. to achieve this we add ‘1’ to every row in the data set.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pig helper -&gt;Relational Operators-&gt;FOREACH template will get us the code</li>
  <li>Our <strong>%DATA%</strong> is <strong>b</strong> and the second <strong>%NEW_DATA%</strong> is “<strong>driverid,event,(int) ‘1’ as occurance;</strong>”</li>
  <li>Complete line of code will look like:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>c = foreach b generate driverid, event, (int) '1' as occurance;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Copy-and-paste the above Pig code into the riskfactor.pig window:</p>

<h4 id="6-calculate-the-total-non-normal-events-for-each-driver">6. Calculate the total non normal events for each driver</h4>

<p>The group statement is important because it groups the records by one or more relations. In this case we would like to group by driver id and iterate over each row again to sum the non normal events.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pig helper -&gt;Relational Operators-&gt;GROUP %VAR% BY %VAR%</strong> template will get us the code</li>
  <li>First <strong>%VAR%</strong> takes <strong>“c”</strong> and second <strong>%VAR%</strong> takes “<strong>driverid;</strong>”</li>
  <li>Complete line of code will look like:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>d = group c by driverid;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Copy-and-paste the above Pig code into the riskfactor.pig window.</p>

  <li>Next use Foreach statement again to add the occurance.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>e = foreach d generate group as driverid, SUM(c.occurance) as t_occ;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="7load-drivermileage-table-and-perform-a-join-operation">7. Load drivermileage table and perform a join operation</h4>

<p>In this section we will load drivermileage table into Pig using Hcatlog and perform a join operation on driverid. The resulting data set will give us total miles and total non normal events for a particular driver.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Load drivermileage using HcatLoader()</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>g = LOAD 'drivermileage' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();

</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pig helper -&gt;Relational Operators-&gt;JOIN %VAR% BY</strong> template will get us the code</li>
  <li>Replace <strong>%VAR%</strong> by ‘<strong>e</strong>’ and after <strong>BY</strong> put ‘<strong>driverid, g by driverid;</strong>’</li>
  <li>Complete line of code will look like:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>h = join e by driverid, g by driverid;

</div>

<p>Copy-and-paste the above two Pig codes into the riskfactor.pig window.</p>

<h4 id="8-compute-driver-risk-factor">8. Compute Driver Risk factor</h4>

<p>In this section we will associate a driver risk factor with every driver. Driver risk factor will be calculated by dividing total miles travelled by non normal event occurrences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will use Foreach statement again to compute driver risk factor for each driver.</li>
  <li>Use the following code and paste it into your Pig script.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>final_data = foreach h generate $0 as driverid, $1 as events, $3 as totmiles, (float) $3/$1 as riskfactor;
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>As a final step store the data into a table using Hcatalog.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>store final_data into 'riskfactor' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here is the final code and what it will look like once you paste it into the editor.</p>

<p><strong>Geolocation has data stored in ORC format</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-~">a = LOAD 'geolocation' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
b = filter a by event != 'normal';
c = foreach b generate driverid, event, (int) '1' as occurance;
d = group c by driverid;
e = foreach d generate group as driverid, SUM(c.occurance) as t_occ;
g = LOAD 'drivermileage' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
h = join e by driverid, g by driverid;
final_data = foreach h generate $0 as driverid, $1 as events, $3 as totmiles, (float) $3/$1 as riskfactor;
store final_data into 'riskfactor' using org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_8.png" alt="Lab3_8" /></p>

<p>Save the file riskfactor.pig by clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button in the left-hand column.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.3: Quick Recap</strong></p>

<p>Before we execute the code, let’s review the code again:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The line <code class="highlighter-rouge">a=</code> loads the geolocation table from HCatalog.</li>
  <li>The line <code class="highlighter-rouge">b=</code> filters out all the rows where the event is not ‘Normal’.</li>
  <li>Then we add a column called occurrence and assign it a value of 1.</li>
  <li>We then group the records by driverid and sum up the occurrences for each driver.</li>
  <li>At this point we need the miles driven by each driver, so we load the table we created using Hive.</li>
  <li>To get our final result, we join by the driverid the count of events in e with the mileage data in g.</li>
  <li>Now it is real simple to calculate the risk factor by dividing the miles driven by the number of events</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to configure the Pig Editor to use HCatalog so that the Pig script can load the proper libraries. In the Pig arguments text box, enter –<strong>useHCatalog</strong>   and click the <strong>Add</strong> button:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that this argument is <strong>case sensistive</strong>. It should be typed exactly “-useHCatalog”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_9.png" alt="Lab3_9" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Arguments</strong> section of the Pig View should now look like the following:<br />
<img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_10.png" alt="Lab3_10" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 3.4: Execute Pig Script on Tez</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>You are now ready to execute the script. Click Execute on Tez checkbox and finally hit the blue <strong>Execute</strong> button to submit the job. Pig job will be submitted to the cluster. This will generate a new tab with a status of the running of the Pig job and at the top you will find a progress bar that shows the job status.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_11.png" alt="Lab3_11" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Wait for the job to complete. The output of the job is displayed in the <strong>Results</strong> section. Your script does not output any result – it stores the result into a Hive table – so your Results section will be empty.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_12.png" alt="Lab3_12" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_13.png" alt="Lab3_13" /></p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Logs</strong> dropdown menu to see what happened when your script ran. Errors will appear here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go back to the Ambari Hive User View and browse the data in the riskfactor table to verify that your Pig job successfully populated this table. Here is what is should look like:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab3_14.png" alt="Lab3_14" /></p>

<p>At this point we now have our truck miles per gallon table and our risk factor table. The next step is to pull this data into Excel to create the charts for the visualization step.</p>

<h4 id="background-in-apache-spark">Background in Apache Spark</h4>

<p>MapReduce has been useful, but the amount of time it takes for the jobs to run can at times be exhaustive. Also, MapReduce jobs only work for a specific set of use cases. There is a need for computing framework that works for a wider set of use cases.</p>

<p>Therefore Apache Spark was designed as a computing platform to be fast, general-purpose, and easy to use. It extends the MapReduce model and takes it to a whole other level. The speed comes from the in-memory computations. Applications running in memory allows for a much faster processing and response.</p>

<h4 id="apache-spark">Apache Spark</h4>

<p><a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/spark/">Apache Spark</a> is a fast, in-memory data processing engine with elegant and expressive development APIs in <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.package">Scala</a>,<a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/api/java/index.html">Java</a>, and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/api/java/index.html">Python</a> that allow data workers to efficiently execute machine learning algorithms that require fast iterative access to datasets. Spark on <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/YARN">Apache Hadoop YARN</a> enables deep integration with Hadoop and other YARN enabled workloads in the enterprise.</p>

<p>You can run batch application such as MapReduce types jobs or iterative algorithms that builds upon each other. You can also run interactive queries and process streaming data with your application. Spark also provides number of libraries which you can easily use to expand beyond the basic Spark capabilities such as Machine Learning algorithms, SQL, streaming, and graph processing. Spark runs on Hadoop clusters such as Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos, or even as a standalone with its own scheduler.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_1.png" alt="Lab4_1" /><br />
Lets get started…!!</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.1: Configuring Spark services using Ambari</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Log on to Ambari Dashboard and click on Actions tab at the bottom left corner. Hit Start All to ensure Spark is running. Ambari will take some time to start all services and you can monitor the progress of it.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_2.png" alt="Lab4_2" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_3.png" alt="Lab4_3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Close the Ambari browser and we will get running with some codes on Spark. ssh into the sandbox using root as login and hadoop as password.</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>login: root
password: hadoop
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Optionally, if you don’t have an SSH client installed and configured you can use the built-in web client which can be accessed from here: <strong>http://<em>host</em>:4200</strong> (use the same username and password provided above)</p>

<ol>
  <li> Type the command spark-shell</li>
</ol>

<p>This will load the default Spark Scala API.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_4.png" alt="Lab4_4" /></p>

<p>Notice it is already starting with Hive integration as we have preconfigured it on the Hortonworks Sandbox.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.2: Create a HiveContext</strong></p>

<p>For improved Hive integration, HDP 2.3 offers <a href="http://hortonworks.com/blog/orcfile-in-hdp-2-better-compression-better-performance/">ORC file</a> support for Spark. This allows Spark to read data stored in ORC files. Spark can leverage ORC file’s more efficient columnar storage and predicate pushdown capability for even faster in-memory processing. HiveContext is an instance of the Spark SQL execution engine that integrates with data stored in Hive. The more basic SQLContext provides a subset of the Spark SQL support that does not depend on Hive. It reads the configuration for Hive from hive-site.xml on the classpath.</p>

<p><strong>Import these sql libraries:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc._
import org.apache.spark.sql._
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_5.png" alt="Lab4_5" /></p>

<p><strong>Instantiate HiveContext</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val hiveContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveContext(sc)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_6.png" alt="Lab4_6" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">sc</code> stands for <strong>Spark Context</strong>. SparkContext is the main entry point to everything Spark. It can be used to create RDDs and shared variables on the cluster. When you start up the Spark Shell, the SparkContext is automatically initialized for you with the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">sc</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4.3: Creating a RDD from HiveContext</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is RDD?</strong></p>

<p>Spark’s primary core abstraction is called Resilient Distributed Dataset or RDD. Essentially it is just a distributed collection of elements that is parallelized across the cluster. What this means is which is that RDD is an immutable collection of objects that is partitioned and distributed across multiple physical nodes of a YARN cluster and that can be operated in parallel.</p>

<p>There are three methods for creating a RDD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can parallelize an existing collection. This means that the data already resides within Spark and can now be operated on in parallel.</li>
  <li>The second method to create a RDD, is to reference a dataset. This dataset can come from any storage source supported by Hadoop such as HDFS, Cassandra, HBase etc.</li>
  <li>The third method to create a RDD is from transforming an existing RDD to create a new RDD. We will be using the later two methods in our tutorial.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="1use-a-simple-show-command-to-see-the-list-of-tables-in-hive-warehouse">1. Use a simple show command to see the list of tables in Hive warehouse.</h4>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>hiveContext.sql("show tables").collect.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_7.png" alt="Lab4_7" /></p>

<p>You will notice that geolocation table and driver mileage table that we created in earlier tutorial are already listed in Hive metastore and can be directly queried upon.</p>

<h4 id="2-query-tables-to-build-spark-rdd">2. Query tables to build Spark RDD</h4>

<p>We will do a simple select query to fetch data from geolocation and drivermileage tables to a spark variable. Getting data into Spark this way also allows to copy table schema to RDD.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val geolocation_temp1 = hiveContext.sql("select * from geolocation")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_8.png" alt="Lab4_8" /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val drivermileage_temp1 = hiveContext.sql("select * from drivermileage")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_9.png" alt="Lab4_9" /></p>

<p>Make sure that the RDD`s carry the exact data. You can verify through following   command</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>geolocation_temp1.take(10) 
drivermileage_temp1.take(10)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Both these commands will return 10 rows from respective RDD`s.</p>

<h4 id="3-registering-a-temporary-table">3. Registering a Temporary table</h4>

<p>Now let’s give this RDD a name, so that we can use it in Spark SQL statements</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>geolocation_temp1.registerTempTable("geolocation_temp1")
drivermileage_temp1.registerTempTable("drivermileage_temp1")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Step 4.4: RDD transformations and Actions</strong></p>

<p>Typically, RDDs are instantiated by loading data from a shared filesystem, HDFS, HBase, or any data source offering a Hadoop InputFormat on a YARN cluster.</p>

<p>Once an RDD is instantiated, you can apply a <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/programming-guide.html#rdd-operations">series of operations</a>. All operations fall into one of two types:<a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/programming-guide.html#transformations">transformations</a> or <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/programming-guide.html#actions">actions</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transformation</strong> operations, as the name suggests, create new datasets from an existing RDD and build out the processing DAG that can then be applied on the partitioned dataset across the YARN cluster. Transformations do not return a value. In fact, nothing is evaluated during the definition of these transformation statements. Spark just creates these Direct Acyclic Graphs or DAG, which will only be evaluated at runtime. We call this lazy evaluation.</li>
  <li>An <strong>Action</strong> operation, on the other hand, executes DAG and returns a value.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="1-querying-against-the-table">1.  Querying against the table</h4>

<p>Now that our schema’s RDD with data has a name, we can use Spark SQL commands to query it. Remember the table below is not a Hive table, it is just a RDD we are querying with SQL.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Here we will try to perform iteration and filter operation. First, we need to filter drivers that have non- normal events associated to them and then count the number for non- normal events for each driver.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val geolocation_temp2 = hiveContext.sql("SELECT driverid, count(driverid) occurance from             geolocation_temp1  where event!='normal' group by driverid")
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As stated earlier about RDD transformations, select operation is a RDD transformation and therefore does not return anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resulting table will have count of total non normal events associated to each driver. Register this filtered table as a temporary table so that subsequent SQL queries can be applied on it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>geolocation_temp2.registerTempTable("geolocation_temp2")
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>You can view the result by doing an action operation on RDD.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>geolocation_temp2.collect.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_11.png" alt="Lab4_11" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Perform join operation</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In this section we will perform a join operation geolocation_temp2 table has details of drivers and count of their respective non-normal events. drivermileage_temp1 table has details of total miles travelled by each driver.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will join two tables on common column, which in our case is driverid.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val joined = hiveContext.sql("select a.driverid,a.occurance,b.totmiles from geolocation_temp2 a,drivermileage_temp1 b where a.driverid=b.driverid")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_12.png" alt="Lab4_12" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The resulting data set will give us total miles and total non normal events for a particular driver. Register this filtered table as a temporary table so that subsequent SQL queries can be applied on it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>joined.registerTempTable("joined")
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>You can view the result by doing an action operation on RDD.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>joined.collect.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_13.png" alt="Lab4_13" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Compute Driver Risk Factor</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In this section we will associate a driver risk factor with every driver. Driver risk factor will be calculated by dividing total miles travelled by non normal event occurrences.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>val risk_factor_spark=hiveContext.sql("select driverid, totmiles,occurance, totmiles/occurance riskfactor from joined")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_14.png" alt="Lab4_14" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The resulting data set will give us total miles and total non normal events and what is a risk for a particular driver. Register this filtered table as a temporary table so that subsequent SQL queries can be applied on it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>risk_factor_spark.registerTempTable("risk_factor_spark")
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>View the results</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>risk_factor_spark.collect.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab4_15.png" alt="Lab4_15" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 4.5: Load and Save Data into Hive as ORC</strong></p>

<p>In this section we will try to store data in orc format in Hive from Spark.ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads and with integrated support for finding required rows fast. Storing data in a columnar format lets the reader read, decompress, and process only the values required for the current query. Because ORC files are type aware, the writer chooses the most appropriate encoding for the type and builds an internal index as the file is persisted.</p>

<p>Predicate pushdown uses those indexes to determine which stripes in a file need to be read for a particular query and the row indexes can narrow the search to a particular set of 10,000 rows. ORC supports the complete set of types in Hive, including the complex types: structs, lists, maps, and unions.</p>

<h4 id="create-an-orc-table">Create an ORC table</h4>

<p>Create a table and store it as ORC. Specifying as orc at the end of the SQL statement below ensures that the Hive table is stored in the ORC format.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>hiveContext.sql("create table finalresults( driverid String, occurance bigint,totmiles bigint,riskfactor double) stored as orc").toDF()
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong> Load data into ORC table</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Before we load the data into hive table that we created above, we will have to convert our data file into orc format too.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>risk_factor_spark.saveAsOrcFile("risk_factor_spark")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Load the data into Hive table using load data command.</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>hiveContext.sql("load data inpath 'risk_factor_spark' into table finalresults")
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Execute a select query to verify your table has been successfully stored.You can go to Ambari Hive user view to check whether the Hive table you created has the data populated in it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>hiveContext.sql("select * from finalresults")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Step 5.b.1: Access the Refined Data with Microsoft Excel</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hdp/addons/">Hive ODBC driver</a> can be found at the Hortonworks Add-on page.  For <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/how-to-install-and-configure-the-hortonworks-odbc-driver-on-windows-7/">Windows ODBC driver setup</a> follow these instructions and these are the <a href="http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/how-to-install-and-configure-the-hortonworks-odbc-driver-on-mac-os-x/">Mac ODBC driver setup</a> instructions.   Open the ODBC connection manager and open the connection you setup up. It should look like this. Click on the test button and it should report success. If the test fails you will need to troubleshoot the connection before you can go on.</p>

<p><strong>For Mac Users</strong>:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new blank workbook. Select Data tab at the top then select “Get External Data” and then select “New Database query”.</li>
  <li>Chose Sample Hortonworks Hive DSN and hit Ok.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_1.png" alt="Lab5_1" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Next prompt shall ask you to enter login and password. Type “sandbox” in login and the leave the password empty. Hit Ok.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_2.png" alt="Lab5_2" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>  Choose the data table avg_mileage table from the table chart on the right and hit      Add Table. avg_mileage should now appear under Query View tab on the left. Choose avg_mileage.* in the Field column. You are set to import data from your Hive table. As a final step, Hit Test!</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_3.png" alt="Lab5_3" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Click on Return Data to import your table into an excel. Submit OK to populate your excel.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_4.png" alt="Lab5_4" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Once the data is placed you will see the avg_mileage table imported into your spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>For Windows users</strong>:-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new blank workbook. Select Data tab at the top then select “Get External Data” and then select “From Other Data Sources”. Then at the bottom select “From Microsoft Query”. Choose your data source and ours is called Hadoop and you will then see the Query Wizard. We will import the avg_mileage table.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_6.png" alt="Lab5_6" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Accept the defaults for everything and click through till you hit the Finish button. After you click on Finish, Excel will send the data request over to Hadoop. It will take awhile for this to happen. When the data is returned it will ask you to place the data in the workbook. We want to be in cell $A$1 like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_61.png" alt="Lab5_6" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> The data is placed you will see the avg_mileage table imported into your spreadsheet.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_7.jpg" alt="Lab5_7" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 5.b.2: Visualize Data with Microsoft Excel</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>So now we are going to insert a Power View report. We do this by selecting the “Insert” tab at the top and select “Power View Reports” button in the middle. This will create a new tab in your workbook with the data inserted in the Power View page.”</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_14.jpg" alt="Lab5_14" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Select the design tab at the top and then select a column chart and use the stacked column version in the drop down menu. This will give you a bar chart. Grab the lower right of the chart and stretch it out to the full pane. Close the filter tab and the chart will expand and look like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_9.jpg" alt="Lab5_9" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> So to finish off the tutorial I am going to create a map of the events reported in the geolocation table. I will show you how you can build up the queries and create a map of the data on an ad hoc basis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> For a map we need location information and a data point. Looking at the geolocation table I will simply plot the location of each of the events. I will need the driverid, city and state columns from this table. We know that the select statement will let me extract these columns. So to start off I can just create the select query in the Query Editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Query subset of geolocation columns</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>select driverid, city, state from geolocation;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_10.png" alt="Lab5_10" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> After I execute the query I see what results are returned. In a more complex query you can easily make changes to the query at this point till you get the right results. So the results I get back look like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_11.png" alt="Lab5_11" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Since my results look fine I now need to capture the result in a table. So I will use the select statement as part of my CTAS (create table select as) pattern. I will call the table events and the query now looks like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create table avg_mileage from existing trucks_mileage data</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CREATE TABLE events
STORED AS ORC
AS
SELECT driverid, city, state FROM geolocation;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_12.png" alt="Lab5_12" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> I can execute the query and the table events gets created. As we saw earlier I can go to Excel and import the table into a blank worksheet. The imported data will look like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_13.jpg" alt="Lab5_13" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Now I can insert the PowerView tab in the Excel workbook. To get a map I just select the Design tab at the top and select the Map button in the menu bar.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_8.jpg" alt="Lab5_8" /></p>

<ol>
  <li> Make sure you have a network connection because Power View using Bing to do the geocoding which translates the city and state columns into map coordinates. If we just want to see where events took place we can uncheck the driverid. The finished map looks like this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/hello-hdp/Lab5_15.jpg" alt="Lab5_15" /></p>

<p>We’ve shown how the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) can store and analyze geolocation data. In addition I have shown you a few techniques on building your own queries. You can easily plot risk factor and miles per gallon as bar charts. I showed you the basics of creating maps. A good next step is to only plot certain types of events. Using the pattern I gave you it is pretty straight forward to extract the data and visualize it in Excel.</p>
