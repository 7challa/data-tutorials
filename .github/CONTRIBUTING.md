- [Questions and Assistance](#questions)
- [Issues, Bugs, and Pull Requests][#issues-and-PRs]

Please note that there is also much information which can be [found on the wiki](https://github.com/hortonworks/tutorials/wiki)!

## <a name="issue"></a> Questions and Assistance

If you are having trouble completing a tutorial we ask that you please first take a look at [Hortonworks Community Connection](https://community.hortonworks.com). Every tutorial has an ID tag which you can search there to see if others have had the same issue. This will help us cut down on the number of questions and issues created in the repository.

If you still haven't found your answer on [Hortonworks Community Connection](https://community.hortonworks.com), then we also encourage you to ask a question there first as well.

If you find an answer to your question, and it requires a change to the tutorial then we ask that you submit an issue here on GitHub.

To help us out we ask that you at least fill in the top portion of the issue template. This will ensure that we can swiftly and accurately update the tutorial so that others can avoid the issue.

Any other questions? Please create an issue with the **question** tag and we will get back to you.

## <a name="issues-and-PRs"></a> Issues, Bugs, and Pull Requests

When creating an Issue in the repository we ask that you please follow the Issue template as closely as possible. This will ensure that we have all of the information needed to update our tutorials.

For every pull request that is created, a corresponding issue should be created as well. This will help us follow our commit history and allow us to look back on the issues we've closed with which commits.

We also ask that you fill in the template for pull requests as well. This will ensure that all of our contributors and committers are on the same page when merging into the main branch.

Any more questions? Create an issue with the question label and let us know.
